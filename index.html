<!-- TODO IMPLEMENT JSON WebTokens (jwtoken), associated with Auth0

- Getting the JWT (token) -
Browser -> POST to /users/login with (username and password) -> server
server -> creates a jwt with a secret -> returns the jwt to the browser in some sort of response -> browser

- Doing a token-authenticated thing -
browser -> sends jwt on authorization Header -> server
server -> checks jwt signature. Gets user information from the jwt -> sends response to the client -> browser
